The project:
- Loads a dataset using 
- Trains a decision tree classifier with `scikit-learn` and the `Chefboost`  framework in Python.
- Evaluates model performance
- Visualizes the decision tree

  ## What is Chefboost?

Chefboost is a lightweight machine learning library for interpretable decision tree learning. It supports various algorithms like ID3, C4.5, CART, and CHAID.
